# O.O.P. 


###### Encapsulation
- Hide variables, use getters and setters
- Hide unnecessary details in our classes and provide a clear and simple interface for working with them.

###### Inheritance
- Improves code readability and enable the reuse of functionality.

###### Abstraction
- Hide implementation
- Deal with objects considering their important characteristics and ignore all other details.

###### Polymorphism
- Work in the same manner with different objects, which define a specific implementation of some abstract behavior.
