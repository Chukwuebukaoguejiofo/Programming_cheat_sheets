Dijkstras - find the shortest path betwen two vertices:



- use a minHeap


- the nodes need to have a 'distance' property/field

- assing 'infinity' to the distance' property/field of all nodes, and the first node to start assign ZERO to the 'distance' property/field



- use two arrays for 'visited' and 'unvisited' nodes



- get the first node of the 'unvisited' array and add it to the 'visited' array  (is it an array???)


- update the 'distance' property/field of the neighbor nodes of the current node to the sum of the current node's 'distance' property/field plus the neighbor's 'distance' property/field  if the  neighbor's 'distance' property/field is grater then the result.   (each current node will have many neighbours)
