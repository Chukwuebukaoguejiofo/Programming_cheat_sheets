display:
    inline or block  (block takes up all the horizontal space)
    inline-block
    none - as if the element is not there
visibility: hidden - invisible but takes up space


position
    static (default) (scrolling moves it)
    relative  (away from its normal position)
    fixed  (scrolling does not move it)
    absolute  (positioned relative to the parent???)

    - top, bottom, left, and right properties.


z-index - which element goes on top of which

width:  (of content in box-model)
    % is relative to the parent
    auto - the browser calculates

max-width:
    % is relative to the parent

Margin
    auto - the browser calculates (to horizontally center the element within its parent.)
    % is relative to the parent
    inherit - (from the parent) (for indentation?)
    -100% or -100px  is allowed - for overlapping

clear
    - specifies which side(s) of an element, floating elements are not allowed to float


overflow: (Specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box)
    auto  - if a element is floating, and part of it is going outside of its parent, use this!
    scroll (clpped, but it will scroll)
    visible(default)|hidden|scroll|auto|initial|inherit;
