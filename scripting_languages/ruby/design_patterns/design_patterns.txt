# factory:
    - a class has `class methods` to create objects of another class.

# singleton
    - a class has a `class method` to return a single instance

# strategy
    - classes with a `work` method that executes an algorithm
    - the client class should have a private field to receive the strategy class
    - the client class should have a method
        that call the `work method` on the 'received strategy'
